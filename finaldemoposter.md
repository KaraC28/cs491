# Presentation + Video + App + Poster

## Generalities

*	The presentations should be formal and professionals. Dress and act accordingly. If on Zoom, open you camera (if you can).
*	You need to consider that nobody knows your project. It is the time for you to present the whole project and to sell it. It is a pitch!
*	Teams are responsible of testing everything BEFORE the presentations.
*	Teams will be timed! You will be cut off if you go overtime. 12 minutes maximum including a 2-minute demo (maximum).
*	Put the link of your presentation, video and poster in the Google Sheet provided. We will retrieve everything from that one-stop place.
*	Share all your presentation and poster with me as an editor such that I can give you feedback.
*	Teams are evaluated with the CS 389 rubrics.
*	Order of the presentations is posted in classes. [randomly generated, no change allowed]

## Presentation

* 12 minutes including the live demo + 2 minutes of questions
* To be done in Google Presentation
* The slides below should be there. You can be creative!

## Slides

* Title slide: Name of the app and team (with pictures) / GitHub link
* Motivation (Why this app? Problem targeted/ Motivation? Market Analysis? Potential? Story Telling…)
* Target Users (Who is this app for? What is the environment of the users? Persona(s)?)
* Main features of the app (Main US) (with corresponding screenshots)
* Process (Description of the process followed? From the ideation phase to the delivery phase? What worked? What didn’t work? What could be improved? What did you learn about agile and scrum? How does the process you follow permits to improve the quality of the product you delivered? Would it have been possible to achieve what you achieved without process?). You may use a timeline.
* 3 burndown charts (one for each sprint) and number of US planned and implemented at each sprint in a table. Use one slide. [Only say 1-2 sentences about the charts]
* GitHub commits and statistics during the project (screenshot). Screenshot of the insights [Only say 1-2 sentences about the use of GitHub]
* Technologies, Tools and APIs (IDE, Photoshop, GitHub, Git, Slack, Discord, databases….). You can separate development, design, communication, project management etc. tools. Use a table maybe. Some of you used many tools, we need to know!
