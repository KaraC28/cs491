# Sprint Planning

## What is your Sprint Goal?

Publish your Sprint Goal in your README.md

* Number of User Stories you will implement during the Sprint
* User Stories you will implement during the Sprint (number + description)
* Velocity you will implement during the Sprint
  * H = 7 points, M = 5 points, L = 3 points

## Create the Sprint Backlog

In the Spreadsheet

* Label the selected User Stories of the Product Backlog with the current Sprint number
* Create a new tab in the Product Backlog spreadsheet with the US and the associated tasks

## Tasks

*	Decompose each User Story into tasks 
*	Assign each task to a team member
*	Estimate the amount of time for each task
*	Every student should plan for 16 hours of work minimum for a sprint

## GitHub Project

In GitHub Project

* You have access to a Kanban board
* Create the US and tasks in the kanban board (as To does)
* Each of the Kanban US and tasks should be converted to issues
* Label the issues with the sprint number, US and task

## Sprint 1 code 

* One of the team members creates the Android Studio project and begins to code
* The code is pushed in the team GitHub repository
* The other team members clone the repo and make some trivial push to the team GitHub repository
* Code comments are only in English

## Rules of GitHub

* You cannot push directly on main
* You work exclusively on your own branch (labeled with your firstname)
* You merge your branch to the main branch using a pull request
* Each developer must have at least 10 pushes / sprint

## Sprint 2 and Sprint 3

* You will only be able to merge from your branch to the main branch after one review
