# Scrum Template

## There are 3 questions in the daily Scrum meeting:

1.	What did I accomplish yesterday?
2.	What will I do today?
3.	What obstacles are impeding my progress?

## For the project we will adapt the questions to the following ones: 

1.	What did I accomplish since the last Scrum?
2.	What will I do until the next Scrum?
3.	What obstacles are impeding my progress?

The calendar contains the dates of each Scrum.  Scrums have to be done individually (you will use I, not We or The team). 

The Scrums are posted on the README.md.
